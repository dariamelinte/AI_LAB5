# Lab 4: Constraint satisfaction problem

## Authors: Melinte Daria & Giosu Stefana - E3

### Problem:

Consider a board of size 9x9, partially filled with digits from 1 to 9. Each row, column, or 3x3 sub-region contains all values from 1 to 9. Certain cells must contain an even number. The problem consists in identifying the missing numbers.
Apply the Forward checking algorithm together with a variable ordering method to determine the solutions of a given instance.


### Steps:

1. Model the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem
    - identify the variables, the domains, the constraints
    - initialize them for a given instance
2. Implement the Forward checking method
3. Implement a variable ordering method.
